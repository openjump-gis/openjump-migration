3) Highlights of new functionality in OpenJUMP 1.3:
===================================================
- new (cartographic) attribute classification methods for color theming.
  (added to equal number and quantiles: i) mean-standard deviation, 
  ii) maximal breaks, iii) Jenks optimal)

- new function that generates a layer attribute statistics table (integrated from PirolJUMP)

- Jython/Python support as second scripting possibility besides BeanShell (integrated from SkyJUMP)

- new raster image reader that allows to directly use Sextante raster/image analysis tools (integrated from PirolJUMP)

- new function to simplify polygon within a tesselation/landscape of polygons

- new tool that allows to add notes in the Editing toolbox

4) Detailed Bugfixes and Improvements between release of OpenJUMP 1.3 and 1.2 (Release F)
(note, latest changes are written on top. So we recommend to read upside down)
=================================================================

- New attribute classification methods work now with integer attributes too.
    
- WMS Encoding layer names and format properly.
    
- Add, remove and fix three small scripts in the BeanTools script directory
    
- Fixed issue/feature request 1938020  - selections generated with
    the spatial query function can now be deleted
    
- Fixed issue (bugreport) 1786353  - improved Layer description for A/B, 
    i.e. what source and what target layer is.
    
- Fixed issue (bugreport) 1779771  - removed confusing scale units / label.
    
- Fixed bug 2673544 - made Cut Polygon Tool undo-able.
    
- Fixed bugs 2628678 and 2514296 - Auto Complete Polygons is now 
    undo-able and adds polygons only to an editable layer (i.e. the
    tool choses the next editable layer for drawing or creates
    a new layer).
    
- Fixed bug 2660257 - enabled reading of LinearRing geometries 
    from JML files.
    
- Added layer context menu functions for Pirol/Sextante raster images.
    
- Created new "statistics" menu in tools. Moved feature-, layer-, 
    and attribute statistics functions into the menu.
    
- Newly created layers are marked with featureCollectionModified=true.
	So when OpenJUMP is closed, it should ask for saving the data.
    
- Integrated RasterImageLayer from Pirol - this will allow to
    use Sextante with OpenJUMP directly (when Sextante bindings are changed too).
    
- Integrated Layer Statistics tool from Pirol.
    To be found in /Tools/Analysis/One Layer/Attribute Statistic Overview
    
- Added further 1-D Classification methods for ColorTheming.
    Besides using the equal-interval and equal-number methods, 
    class breaks can now be calculated using i) Mean-Standard Deviation,
    ii) maximal breaks, iii) Jenks optimal breaks.
    Note: The equal-number breaks calculation has been replace with one contained
    in Classifier1D to keep consistent with API methods (however, tests show that
    the old and the new method deliver slightly different results)

- Integrated Jython tools from ISA / SkyJUMP.
 
- Disabled plugin that allows panning with keys due to feedback with layer navigation
    to re-enable add the following line to default-plugin.xml	  
    
- Added functions to sort categories by name and number of features 
    
- Added changes to openjump.sh script from Peppe, so loading of JYthon should 
    work with Debian now (and not only with Windows)
    
- Replaced jts 1.9 with jts 1.10
    
- Added function to delete features from a layer that have the same geometry.
    
- Fixed bug 1821235 : with respect to loading *.ECW images

- New Function: Search All Attributes aims to add search engine capability to a gis.
   
- Added function to simplify polygons if they are part of a tesselation in Tools/Generalization.
    
- Added function to extract boundaries of polygons in Tools/Edit Geometry/Convert/.
    This function can be used to simplify the boundaries and then to recreate 
    simplified polygons. 
	
- Internationalization for Extract Point plugin. 

- Removal of ISA simplification plugin (made init as comment in default-plugins.xml).
        
- Modified findMaxStringLength in Shape File Writer to not allow zero length string fields  
    
- Fixed bug with cutting polygon with hole and linestring did 
    not go through the hole.      
    
- Make the original JUMP NoteTool available as a PlugIn.     
    
- Fix the size of combo boxes in the simple query editor
    to prevent the query dialog panel to become too large
    
- Applied a patch from Hisaji Ono to write 2 bytes character
    correctly in dbf files
    
- Fixed bug in PlanarGraphPlugIn

- Added PlugIn to Combine Selected Layers both geometry and attributes 
    with automatic colour theming on created layer attribute.     
    
- Display of number of features per layer for layer-name tooltip
  
- Re-ordering of menu items

- Added support to for extending multiple selected LineStrings or joining 
    two with a connection 
    
- Added new tool to extract point features from other layer with other geometry types
 
- Added Larry's Clip-To-Fence function from ISA Tools
	
- Extended Thiessen polygon creation to be aware of a delineating
	background polygon (i.e. points are sorted out and polygon is used
	for clipping)  
	
- Added Larry's Auto-Assign-Attribute function from ISA Tools
	
- Enabled the Union check box when Get Distance from Attributes is checked.
     
- Added patch by Bing to parse single bytes in dbf files, which is better 
	for chinese characters [see email topic on googlegroups: "patchs for 
	reading dbf files with multi-bytes character columns"]

- Added error checking to prevent problems after pasting a Style 
      that refers to a missing Attribute.

- Updated snapping policy to allow snapping to lines of multi polygons
	(and geometry collections in general).

- Changed BufferPlugIn to take advantage of new UnaryUnionOp.union() method of JTS 1.9

- Fixed null pointer when reading from project file.

- Set the default button for Enter key to the OK.

- Replace old progressiveUnion optimization by the new UnaryUnionOp of 
      JTS 1.9 which is much faster

- Replace string intern() by a local hashmap to avoid duplicating strings 
  when reading Shape/DBF files

- (Re-)Enabled the styling of basic style + vertex style.

- Added the Plume tool to the Tools->Generate menu. Select a single 
      LineString and enter start and end radii.

- Moved all "advanced" plugin functionality to the "default-plugins.xml" file. 
      Basic functionality (such as file i/o, viewing and styling) is still loaded 
      from the OpenJumpConfiguration file.

- Added new command-line parameter "-default-plugins" to load a "second"
      properties file. Plugins read from a properties file with 
      "-default-plugins" will be loaded before the plugins from 
      "-workbench-properties". It is intended to deliver a "default-plugins.xml"
      in the /bin/ directory of OpenJUMP. (Note: using two properties files
      enables to separate general OJ plugins from own functions)
     
- Added Multi-Ring-Buffer Function for selected objects (a similar function 
      can be found in ArcGIS:
      http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=multiple_ring_buffer_(analysis) )

- Added "Get distance from attribute" option to Buffer.  
      Currently it disables the Union option.
             
- Fixed a null pointer when selected layer is no WMS layer.


- Added capability to select image format for WMS layers/requests.

- Changed naming of rules for color theming styles.

- Added exporting of angle attribute for label styles.

- Improved/re-added SLD import of color theming styles.

- Added patch from Jakko which allows use of WMS servers protected
      with basic HTTP authentication. Credentials are taken from URL,
      which can be entered as 'http://user:password@server/path'

- Added new function to intersect two layers that contain
      polygons under /Tools/Two Layers/. The function allows in
      a second step to transfer the attributes from both
      source layers.

- Enabled loading of Mr.SID layers using the new OpenFramework
          (note: problems exist with deleting the temp-jpg-files in
          MrSIDReferencedImage.paint)

- Fixed parsing of WMS capabilities without GetFeatureInfo section.

- Added wms-default url to http://openaerialmap.org/wms/, bug [1944641]

- Fixed bug [1729554] in extension manager

- Added Auto Complete Polygon Tool from Uni Hannover via Malte W.

- New Synchronization menu that allows to make a mosaic of several map windows
  and to synchronize those map window when panning and zooming
