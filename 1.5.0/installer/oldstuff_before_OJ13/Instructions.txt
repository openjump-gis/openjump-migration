Instructions for generating a win32 installer for OpenJUMP
----------------------------------------------------------
Steve tanner

To create an OpenJUMP installer for win32 we use NSIS, the NullSoft
Installation System (nsis.sourceforge.net). In order to correctly
behave, the procedure needs the following folder structure, normally
present on the CVS of the openjump module on jump-pilot.sourceforge.net

/distrib   contains the generated .exe installer
/etc       contains licences and .xml files
/installer contains all the stuff for generating the installer
/lib       contains the jar files (should also contain the openjump jars)

The following steps are used:

1. Edit the nsi script "installer_openjump_exe.nsi"
   This can be done by hand or using the excellent HM NIS Edit
   allowing to create also user custom pannels under the form
   of .ini files

2. Place in the /lib folder the current jar versions of openjump
   They can be extracted from a chosen build, for instance:
   \lib\jump-workbench-20060112-0047.jar
   \lib\jump-api-20060112-0047.jar
   
3. Copy the file oj.exe from an older release (i.e. from the trunk). 

4. Launch the NSIS program and execute "installer_openjump_exe.nsi"
