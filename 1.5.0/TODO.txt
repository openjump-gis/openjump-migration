	some stuff I collected that should be done:
	from 2006/2007
	- ask Paul: "freedesktop" file for Jump - howTo
	- remove old postgis lib? / add import postgis layer script to beanshell stuff (wiki help): internal datastore
	- add MoveVertexTool from kosmo (larry16.03.-17:11)
	- ascii point/cvs import (see also Pirol tool)
	- item info (Cadcorp like)
	and (probably from 2007):
	- PostGIS plugin (emails 19.05.), I guess this was about the icon for the new file dialog
	- set drawing line color
	- Pauls Docking-Design
	- add WorkbenchContext.getMenuNames()? Larry
	- make new styling report (mm: 16.Aug 2007)
	- add requests by Guiseppe Aruta (30. Aug - see answers - by Larry - first)

  * Check how the LoadDatasetFromPlugIn and SaveDatasetAsPlugin work with OSX.
    mmichaud removed the Load/SaveDatasetAsFilePlugIn but ssteiniger reported
    that the plugin let by mmichaud does not show ok button on OSX.
    Can someone with OSX make more test and report what happens ?
    
  * There is room for much more cleaning in the old driver api. Here are all
    the classes which could be removed/modified if nobody use the old driver
    api :
    Those classes are no more used in the core of OpenJUMP
        jumptest.io.AbstractDriverPanelProxy
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.driver.* (14 classes)
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.AbstractDriverPanel
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.BasicFileDriverPanel
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.DriverDialog
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.DriverPanelCache
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.FMEFileDriverPanel
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.GMLFileDriverPanel
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.JMLFileDriverPanel
    And those one have to be modified if the previous are removed
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.plugin.PlugInContext
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.JUMPWorkbench
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.JUMPWorkbenchContext
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.WorkbenchContext
