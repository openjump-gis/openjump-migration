OpenJUMP (migration test)
=========================

***Disclaimer: this repository has only been created to test a possible migration of OpenJUMP (core) from [its current SVN repository](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jump-pilot/code/) to Git, as well as a JTS 1.15+ update. If you're looking a stable version, the latest OpenJUMP release (1.15) can be downloaded [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jump-pilot/files/OpenJUMP/1.15/).***

OpenJUMP is a community driven fork of JUMP the "Java Unified Mapping Platform" GIS software. The original JUMP was developed by Vivid Solutions, released under GPL2 in 2003 and discontinued in 2006.

During 2004 already some enthusiastic developers joined together to enhance further the features of JUMP. They launched an independent development branch called OpenJUMP. The name gives credit to the original JUMP development, and at the same time describes the objectives of this project to be fully open to anyone wanting to contribute.

These days OpenJUMP is developed and maintained by (some few) volunteers around the globe. If you need functionality or even better want to contribute you are very welcome to [contact us](https://sourceforge.net/p/jump-pilot/mailman/jump-pilot-devel/).
