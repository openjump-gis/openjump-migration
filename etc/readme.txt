3. Running OpenJUMP
-------------------
Run the startup scripts contained in the /bin folder:
- For windows, double-click on "oj_windows.bat" or "OpenJUMP.exe"
- For Linux/Unix, launch oj_linux.sh
- For Mac, launch oj_mac.command

Further notes can be found on our wiki:
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jump-pilot/
and on 
http://www.openjump.org


Startup options
-----------------
Several startup options are available, either for the Java Virtual Machine, 
or for the OpenJUMP core. To change them, edit the startup script accordingly.
The scripts contain documentation comments, don't be afraid.

Note, that Windows users that like to start OpenJUMP with the OpenJUMP.exe 
launcher will need to modify OpenJUMP.ini.  

Java VM options (a complete list can be found in the Java VM documentation)
-Xms defines the allocated memory for the virtual machine at startup.
Example: -Xms256M will allocate 256M of memory for OpenJUMP
-Xmx defines the maximum allocated memory for the virtual machine.
Example: -Xmx256M
-Dproperty=value set a system property. 
At the moment, the following properties are used:
  -Dswing.defaultlaf for enforcing a specific Look and Feel. 
    Several possibilities:
    Metal L&F
     -Dswing.defaultlaf=javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel
    Windows L&F
     -Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel
  -Dlog4j.configuration for defining the configuration file for Log4j. 
    e.g. by default:
     Dlog4j.configuration=file:./log4j.xml
     
OpenJUMP command line options
-default-plugins <file.xml>
  Specifies the configuration file of a standard set of functions realized
  as plugins. For example almost all functions of the "Tools" menu.
  This is configured as
    -default-plugins bin\default-plugins.xml 
-properties <file.xml> 
  specifies the file where OpenJUMP persistent properties are stored.
  Default setting is 
    -properties bin\workbench-properties.xml
-plug-in-directory <path> 
  Sets the location of the plugin directory. 
  Default setting is
    -plug-in-directory lib/ext
-i18n <locale>
  Overrides the operating systems default locale setting (language, 
  number format etc.) For example:
  - For starting OpenJUMP in French: use -i18n fr
  - languages available (09/2011): 
    cz (czech)

5. OpenJUMP history
-------------------
OpenJUMP is a "fork" of the JUMP "Java Unified Mapping Platform" software,
developed by Vividsolutions and released in 2003.
During 2004, some enthusiastic developers joined together to enhance further 
the features of JUMP. They launched an independent development branch called 
OpenJUMP. This name gives credit to the original JUMP development, and at the 
same time describes the objectives of this project to be fully open to anyone
wanting to contribute.
Since May 2005 a complete development source is available at:
www.sourceforge.net/projects/jump-pilot
