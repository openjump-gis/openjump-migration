Dear Developer,

this is a quick an dirty note on what's necessary to make your own built of OpenJUMP.

what you need to built OpenJUMP:
- the ANT builder (http://ant.apache.org/)
- either a download of the nightly built src-package from www.openjump.org 
  or a checkout of the sources from the cvs
- A installation of a JAVA SDK.

If you have done the downloads and and installed ANT
(it should be contained already in Eclipse),
then you have to create an arbitrary folder.
In Eclipse this might be done by creating a "simlpe" project.
This folder must contains the following subfolders:
* \build => here the class files from the ant built will be stored
           (note: you may create the folder by yourself if not contained in the download)
* \dist => after building you will find here you distribution files
           (note: you may create the folder by yourself if not contained in the download)
* \docs => is currently empty but will later contain some pdf files
           (note: you may create the folder by yourself if not contained in the download)
* \etc => this must contains several files including the built.xml file for ANT
           (take the folder from the download)
* \lib => contains all the necessary libraries (including 2 subfolders: \Batik and \ext)
           (take the folder from the download)
* \scripts => should contain the openJUMP start-up scripts for different OS
           (take the folder from the download)
* \src => includes the Jump\OpenJUMP source files needed to built OpenJUMP.
           It shoudl contain at least 4 subfolders: 
	\src\com 
	\src\org 
	\src\de
	\src\language, 
	whereby the latter constains the language files to start-up OpenJUMP in different languages. 
	(take all the folders from the download)

If you have now all these folders in one, then go to the \etc\ folder and look for the file built.xml. Start this file with ANT. In Eclipse it might work to simply click on built.xml file and then choose from the mouse-menu the option to "run" with ANT.

note: OpenJUMP can be built with Java 1.5 or later 

If you have Questions on OpenJUMP, please have a look first on our wiki: http://www.openjump.org
If you want to report a bug or feature request please do (both):
	1) write on the jpp-devel email list (note: you must register for that)
	2) add the bug or feature request to the corresponding project lists
for 1) and 2) see our project website: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jump-pilot/

i think thats it???
