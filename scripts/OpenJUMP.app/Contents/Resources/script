## open a terminal and run the mac shell script in it, parameters are ignored
## as 'open' does route them into the called app, instead of into the script
## NOTE: start 'oj_macosx.command' manually in finder to achieve the same
#open -a Terminal "$(dirname "$0")/../../../oj_macosx.command"
## run shell script in background with dropped files/folders
sh "$(dirname "$0")/../../../oj_macosx.command" "$@"
