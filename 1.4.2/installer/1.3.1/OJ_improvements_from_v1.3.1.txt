The OpenJUMP version 1.3.1 is primarily a maintenance release to solve a problem with the tiff image file export. So there are is only one new feature for working with PostGIS queries, compared to version 1.3.


3) Highlights of new functionality in OpenJUMP 1.3.1 compared to Version 1.2F:
=============================================================================
- new (cartographic) attribute classification methods for color theming.
  (added to equal number and quantiles: i) mean-standard deviation, 
  ii) maximal breaks, iii) Jenks optimal)

- new function that generates a layer attribute statistics table (integrated from PirolJUMP)

- Jython/Python support as second scripting possibility besides BeanShell (integrated from SkyJUMP)

- new raster image reader that allows to directly use Sextante raster/image analysis tools (integrated from PirolJUMP)

- the list of functions available in the "tools" menu is now configurable with the file "default-plugins.xml"

- new function that allows searching in all attribute values over all layers

- new function to simplify polygon within a tesselation/landscape of polygons

- new tool that allows to add notes in the Editing toolbox

- new Auto-Complete-Polygon tool

- new snychronization function for map views for panning and zooming operations

- ...for more new functions see below...

4) Detailed Bugfixes and Improvements between release of OpenJUMP 1.3.1 and 1.3
(note, latest changes are written on top. So we recommend to read upside down)
=================================================================

from the SVN history:
* Added hungarian language file
* made the Scale Style Panel smaller (ScaleStylePanel)
* added some API methods for FeatureSchema analysis and copying to make life easier (package apitools)
* solved character encoding problems for UTF8

from the regular log entries:

2009-12-05 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>
	   * srid parameter for the view or the fence
          
2009-12-04 mentaer <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>
        changed OJ Version to 1.3.1 to prepare new release
        
2009-12-03 mentaer <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>
        Fixed problem with Pirol world file writer. Tiff images were shifted by
        0.5 pixel since the coords have been taken directly from the envelope
        and not adjusted for the pixel center. 
        
2009-11-22 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>
        * now possible to add a ${view} or ${fence} parameter to limit the query
          to the wiew or to the fence

2009-07-07 stranger <schmitz@lat-lon.de>
        Fixed yet another dangling progress window.

2009-06-25 stranger <schmitz@lat-lon.de>
        Workaround to get correct namespace bindings in SLD output documents
        using recent Java versions.

2009-05-17 mentaer <sstein@geo.unizh.ch>
        Added Patch to remove compiling dependence to the proprietary
        ermapper.jar by Sascha Teichman. However, the change will allow
        to use the ermapper jar and dlls during OJ runtime.

2009-05-16 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    Optimization for large selection deletion :
        * optimize FeatureDataset.removeAll, using FID for removeAll method
        * optimize EditTransaction.setGeometries(), creating an index on the fly
    Fixed an issue throwing IndexOutOfBoundException in ViewSchemaPlugIn
    Reformatting and cleaning of shapefile.PolygonHandler

2009-05-12 stranger <schmitz@lat-lon.de>
        Fixed accidental double encoding of layer names.

2009-04-23 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    Fix a bug in findCWHoles. Could create a 'outer hole' because the test to
    check if a ring contains another ring was a quick and dirty test.

2009-04-23 michaudm <michael.michaud@free.fr>
    Fixed issue related to "Newly created layers are marked with
    featureCollectionModified=true" (see 2009-02-20) :
    need to set layerManager.setFiringEvents(false) during layer loading in
    AddDataStoreLayerPlugIn.
    Note that there is duplicated code since addition of the new
    AddDataStoreLayerWizard (see issue fixed on 2009-04-05)

2009-04-20 Andreas Schmitz <schmitz@lat-lon.de>
    Fixed proper disposal of progress dialog (TaskMonitor).
