Like most open source packages, the Jump DB plugin was built on the "shoulders 
of giants", on top of contributions from countless developers.  Special thanks 
to the original developers of Jump and OpenJump for providing a pluggable 
GIS editor.

The original version of the plugin was created by Larry Reeder, who still
maintains the package.

Thanks goes to Nicolas Ribot for submitting patches that made the plugin 
modal, provided a query history, status bar, and several other nice 
enhancements.

Another thanks to the following people for providing translations:

Edgar Soldin - German
Giuseppe Aruta - Italian and Spanish
Jukka Rahkonen - Finnish
MichaÃ«l Michaud - French

Also, thanks to Wei GuoBing for suggestions on determining if a column
in an Oracle table is a spatial type.
