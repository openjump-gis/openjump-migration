Version 1.2.0 C (2007-08-11)

  This release includes

  New Features:
  - Improve Tools > Edit Geometry > Segments extracter
    Now, the plugin optionally removes segments appearing several times (as in
    the JCS equivalent plugin) and optionally merges the result
  - Improve Tools > Analysis > Union
    Now, the plugin can union a layer or a selection, as in SkyJUMP
  - Added Tools > Analysis > UnionByAttributePlugIn

  
  Changes in the user interface:
  - JoinTablePlugIn now called from tools/edit attributes menu
  - Fixed an alignment problem in the BasicStylePanel
  - Now, every internal frames related to a TaskFrame (table view or info frame)
    are closed before the TaskFrame (with a confirmation dialog)
  - Removed File > Loading Dataset From File and
                   Save Dataset As File
    added automatic file extension in the main Save Dataset As
    and put the format chooser at the bottom of the dialog (as in SkyJUMP)
  - Add WMS Query : updated the demo.deegree.org URL to a working value
  - The WMS field remembers the last used server address
  - Added context menu entry on layer list that allows changing the layer name
    Changed ToggleVisibilityPlugin to allow changing WMS layer visibility toggling
  - set EditTransaction.ROLLING_BACK_INVALID_EDITS_KEY = true when starting up
    OJUMP (i.e. invalid geometries are not alowed per default, switch can be
    done in Edit Options Panel)
  - Changed the URL field to a editable combo box (OpenJUMP now stores a list of
    urls instead of just one)
  
  Fixes and performance improvements:
  - I18N (no more exception when a string is missing)
  - Improved shapefilereader performances (memory use and loading time)
  - Fixed error with length-constraint text field in ConstraintsOptionsPanel
  - Several bug fixes with the new BeanToolsPlugIn
  - Fixed bug 1713295 (Snap always on)
  - Fixed bug 1367145 : "End feathers" decoration appeared on wrong end
  - Fixed a bug in WMSLayer.java: Cache last WMS result with a SoftReference
  - Fixed the memory leak problem when removing a Layer
  - Improved the rendering pipeline
  - Always construct WMSLayer so that they are fetched in parallel running
    threads
  - ZoomBar optimization to reduce UI latency
  - Stop throwing an exception when there are several geometry column in a
    postgis table (consider the first geometry column as the feature geometry)
  - Read PostGIS geometry columns as if it was WKB instead of WKT as it seems
    to be the standard now
  - Backport Larry's bug-fix to enable workbench-properties file outside the IDE
    (see bug 1726102)
  - Fix bug 1691834 about labelling (can label above, on are below lines again)
  - Fixed the "Closing Cloned Window" bug (1475013) : now, layer manager
    resources are released only when the last internal frame using it is closed.
  - Fixed a problem with TaskFrame closing (related to bug 1726629)
  - Fixed for expensive BasicStyle construction (slowed down colour theming a lot)
  - Replacement for the old ThreadQueue. Now worker threads are kept alive for
    at least 5 seconds waiting for new incomming jobs.
  - Fixed a bug in the optimization code of UnionPlugIn
  - SLD Size element is now next to the Mark element and not underneath it.
    XSLUtility is now checking for null while constructing background
  - Added improved startup script for Unix from Paul Austin
  - Changed InfoModel to remove layers after the listeners are notified
  - Fixed a bug in LabelStyle : added trim() to avoid labels to be ex-centered
  - Fixed a bug where thick closed lines (and polygons) did not have a nice
    join_bevel on the first/last point
  - Replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar
  - Bug fixed thanks to Malte, to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy
    of a FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
    (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)
  - SLD PlugIn : Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing
    encoding problems in resulting XML files
  - WMS Layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
    While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
    box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed
  - resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX
  - ShapefileWriter : an Exception is thrown if one try to save a shapefile with
    mixed geometries (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons are stored)
  - fixed a bug in Simple Query (responsible of confusion between the
    three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers

  Many new translations
  
  Code clean up (fixed javadoc tags, removed duplicated imports, unused files)
