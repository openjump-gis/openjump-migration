Instructions for generating a win32 installer for OpenJUMP
----------------------------------------------------------

needed a compiled version of OpenJUMP with Ant (using build.xml)
the input:
an OpenJUMP folder that constains the folders
 
/bin	   contains OJ start files
/lib       contains the jar files (should also contain the openjump jars)

the file in this folder (containing scripts, images and icons)  

Three programs are required: 
	. Launch4j (not necessarily)
	. HM NSIS Editor
	. NSIS program

---------------------------------------

The following steps are used:

1. Step 1-3 can be skipped by copying the oj.exe or openjump.exe file 
   (that was once created by Peppe and is only a link to the openjump.bat file)
   from a previous distribution or from the repository.
   otherwise:
   Create the OpenJUMP.exe using launch4j (jsmooth.sourceforge.net)
   For this, launch launch4j and load the script openjump.launch4j_stefanl.xml

2. Edit the fields so that they point to the correct location and version info

3. create the openjump.exe file using the "build wrapper" button

4. copy the exe file to /bin/ folder 

5. make a copy of the OJ folders and test if OJ starts

6. Launch HM NSIS Editor and load the file: "installojump131.nsi"

7. Edit the file, i.e. adapt the locations and files to install 
   (or create a new file with the wizard)

8. Launch the NSIS program and execute "installojump131.nsi"

9. Test the newly created setup file.
