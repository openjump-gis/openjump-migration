  * Check how the LoadDatasetFromPlugIn and SaveDatasetAsPlugin work with OSX.
    mmichaud removed the Load/SaveDatasetAsFilePlugIn but ssteiniger reported
    that the plugin let by mmichaud does not show ok button on OSX.
    Can someone with OSX make more test and report what happens ?
    
  * There is room for much more cleaning in the old driver api. Here are all
    the classes which could be removed/modified if nobody use the old driver
    api :
    Those classes are no more used in the core of OpenJUMP
        jumptest.io.AbstractDriverPanelProxy
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.driver.* (14 classes)
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.AbstractDriverPanel
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.BasicFileDriverPanel
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.DriverDialog
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.DriverPanelCache
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.FMEFileDriverPanel
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.GMLFileDriverPanel
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.JMLFileDriverPanel
    And those one have to be modified if the previous are removed
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.plugin.PlugInContext
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.JUMPWorkbench
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.JUMPWorkbenchContext
        com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.WorkbenchContext
