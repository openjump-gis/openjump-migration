            3800 to save a high resolution image.  A fence icon appears to the left
            of the X box if there is a fence layer, indicating taht it will be
            used in place of the view window to define the picture bounds.

            DataSource class, and source path.  It works on single or multiple

          contrasting color to improve readability when using a mixed background

          to stop text from rendering when zoomed out too far to actually read it

          $HOME/.jump/.

          and added a listener to update comboboxes when
          layers are added to the task

          Made setSelectedLayers() public in TreeLayerNamePanel to support this function.

- fixed the interned string problem in DbfFile reader with large datasets where
          every attribute value was different by adding exception handler
          that stops further interns

          popup menu item.  It was totally nonfunctional.
