Instructions for generating a win32 installer for OpenJUMP
----------------------------------------------------------

needed a compiled version of OpenJUMP with Ant (using build.xml)
the input:
an OpenJUMP folder that contains the folders
 
/bin	   contains OJ start files
/lib       contains the jar files (should also contain the openjump jars)
/licenses  contains the license files

the file in this folder (containing scripts, images and icons)  

Three programs are required: 
	. HM NSIS Editor
	. NSIS program

---------------------------------------

The following steps are used:


1. make a copy of the OJ folders and test if OJ starts

2. Launch HM NSIS Editor and load the file: "openjump-installer-script.nsi"
   The JRE loader part was broken. I made it work, but now, it needs JREDyna.bsh
   and the NSIS InetLoad plugin [mmichaud for version 1.4.0.2]

3. Edit the file, i.e. adapt the locations and files to install 
   (or create a new file with the wizard)
   As I could ,ot make it work, I had to rebuild one from the wizard [mmichaud]

4. Launch the NSIS program and execute "openjump-installer-script.nsi"

5. Test the newly created setup file.
