Bugfixes and Improvements done since release of OpenJUMP 1.2 B:

- fixed a problem with the window turning black when an Image Layer
		was added due to the graphics context composite being changed.
		
- added support for mouse wheel zooming when the zoom cursor is over 

- set default SRID to -1 for PostGIS


- Fixed a bug (submitted by Hisaji Ono) where some edges had
          wrong links to faces. The method has been entirely rewritten.

- added a warning message in language files to manage the case where
          one tries to transfer attributes from an heterogeneous layer with
          PlanarGraphPlugIn

- fixed a bug in Simple Query PlugIn (responsible of confusion between the
          three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers

- ShapefileWriter: added that an Exception is thrown, when layer geometries are of different type. 
		  Data aren't saved then. (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons are stored)

- removed openjump-mac.sh file since the new openjump.sh
          file works under MAC-OSX as well

- set EditTransaction.ROLLING_BACK_INVALID_EDITS_KEY = true when starting up
          OJUMP (i.e. invalid geometries are not alowed per default, switch can be
          done in Edit Options Panel)

- Tried to fix issue
          http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1246588&group_id=118054&atid=679906
          instead fixed the issue for SaveImageAsSVGPlugin and SaveProjectAsPlugin.

- Added context menu entry on layer list that allows changing the layer name.
          Changed ToggleVisibilityPlugin to allow changing WMS layer visibility
          toggling.

- The WMS field remembers the last used server address.

- resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX.
          The problem was caused by the validation method that always
          returned false. The workaround does not use validation, but
          only for MacOSX computers. To check the OS a new class was added.

- WMS layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
          While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
          box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed.

- updated the demo.deegree.org URL to a working value.

- Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing encoding
          problems in resulting XML files.


- added fix by Malte to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy of a
          FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
          (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)

- replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar wich does only
          contain the org.jmat packages. 

- Bug fix in LabelStyle : added trim() to avoid labels to be ex-centered

- Bug fix : thick closed lines (and polygons) did not have a nice
          join_bevel on the first/last point (tip from Larry Becker)

- improvement: scripts/openjump.sh: Added improved startup script for Unix from
          Paul Austin.

- improvement: Add UnionByAttributePlugIn in the Tool/Analysis menu

- Remove several plugins related to loading/saving files and which are
          no more useful (two plugins in the workbench.ui.plugin package and
          two other plugins in the datasource package)

- improvement: Add automatic file extension in the main SaveDatasetAsPlugIn
          and put the format chooser at the bottom of the dialog (as in SkyJUMP)

- Fix a bug in the Comparator used to sort geometries and
          improve union performance.

- improvement: for expensive BasicStyle construction (slowed down colour theming a lot)

- improvement: added dissolve beanshell script by Hisaji

- Fix a problem with TaskFrame
          closing (related to bug 1726629) : now, every internal frames
          related to a TaskFrame (table view or info frame) are closed
          before the TaskFrame (with a confirmation dialog)

- Fix the "Closing Cloned Window" bug (1475013) : now, layer manager
          resources are released only when the last internal frame using it
          is closed.

- Fix bug 1691834 about labelling (can label above, on are below
          lines again)

- improvement: Backport Larry's bug-fix to enable
          workbench-properties file outside the IDE (see bug 1726102)

- Fix
          Add double-quotes around column names to be able to query
          mixed-case column names. There may be a similar bug for schema
          and table names (see bug report 1694304), but this happens
          somewhere else in the code.

- improvement:
          Several optimization to be able to visualize data as wireframes
          while dragging the zoombar, even with big features and large
          dataset (use of Java2DConverter decimator, selection of large
          data instead of random data, elimination of invisible layers in
          the feature selection...)

- improvement: Including SkyJUMP's improvements concerning the rendering pipeline (point
          coordinates decimation, selection renderer)

- Fix the memory leak problem
          when removing a Layer (the LayerRender cache was not freed)

- Improvement: Cache last WMS result with a SoftReference


- Improvement: Union can now union a layer or a selection, like
          in SkyJUMP

- Improve segments extracter -> optionally removes segments
          appearing several times like the JCS equivalent plugin and
          optionally merge the result)

- fixed bug: line width textField set on the same line as the line
          width slider in the basic style panel

- fixed bug: "End feathers" decoration appeared on wrong end

- fixed bug 1713295 (Snap always on)

- update brazilian language file

- Fix BeanTools NPE : don't  load BeanTools plugin if the plugin directory is missing
