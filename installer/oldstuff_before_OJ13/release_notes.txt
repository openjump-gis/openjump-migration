1. What's new
-------------
This is the first official release of OpenJUMP under the form of a Windows installer.
This version 1.0 has some new features compared to the JUMP original software:
- Export to SVG
- Simple query dialog
- Many new tools for editing and selection


2. License
----------
OpenJUMP is distributed under the GPL license. A description of this license
can be found in the "license.txt" file on the same location than this readme file.
OpenJUMP uses the BATIK libraries to write svg format. The BATIK libraries are
used under the terms of the APACHE license, which can be found on www.apache.org.


3. Running OpenJUMP
-------------------
The installer sets shortcuts for launching the application. However, startup options
can be changed by editing the startup script "JUMPWorkbench.bat" contained in 
the /bin folder of the installation folder:

Further notes can be found on our wiki: www.openjump.org

Users of looks extension should place all the jar files from looks-extension 
directly into /lib/ext.
  	 
Startup options
-----------------
Several startup options are available, either for the Java Virtual Machine, or for the
OpenJUMP core. To change them, edit the startup script
accordingly, editing the line beginning by "start javaw".

Java VM options (a complete list can be found in the Java VM documentation)
-Xms defines the allocated memory for the virtual machine at startup. Example: -Xms256M
 will allocate 256M of memory for OpenJUMP
-Xmx defines the maximum allocated memory for the virtual machine. Example: -Xmx256M
-Dproperty=value set a system property. For the moment, these properties are used:
  -Dswing.defaultlaf  for defining the OpenJUMP Look and Feel. Several possibilities:
     -Dswing.defaultlaf=javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel for the Metal L&F
     -Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel for the Windows L&F
  -Dlog4j.configuration for defining the configuration file for Log4j. Normally:
     Dlog4j.configuration=file:./log4j.xml
     
OpenJUMP command lines
-properties filename : specifies the name of the file where OpenJUMP properties are stored.
 Default is -properties workbench-properties.xml
-plug-in-directory path : defines the location of the plugin directory. 
 Default is %LIB%/ext where %LIB% is defined earlier in the startup script.
-i18n locale : defines the locale (language, etc.) used by OpenJUMP. For example:
  - For starting OpenJUMP in French: use -i18n fr
  - Other languages available: de (german), es (spanish), pt_BR (brazilian portuguese)
  - Default is english if the specified language is not implemented.

  
4. Support
----------
General questions regarding OpenJUMP can be found in:
- www.jump-project.org  the original JUMP site
- www.openjump.org the OpenJUMp website
- jump-pilot.sourceforge.net the old OpenJUMP developper site


5. OpenJUMP history
-------------------
OpenJUMP is a "fork" of the JUMP "Java Unified Mapping Platform" software, developed
by Vividsolutions and released in 2003.
During 2004, some enthusiastic developers joined together to enhance further the 
features of JUMP. They launched an independent development branch called OpenJUMP.
This name gives credit to the original JUMP development, and at the same time 
describes the particularity of this project to be fully open to anyone wanting
to contribute.
Since May 2005 a complete development environment is available at:
www.sourceforge.net/projects/jump-pilot
And a website for OpenJUMP is under construction at: www.openjump.org
